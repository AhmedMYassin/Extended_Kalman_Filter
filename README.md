# Extended Kalman Filter Project Starter Code
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

In this project I estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements. The accepted creiteria for the filter output is to make the RMSE <= {0.11, 0.11, 0.55, 0.55} for {x_position, y_poistion, x_velocity, y_velicity}.

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

I have for this project 2 Datasets and the output of both as following:
